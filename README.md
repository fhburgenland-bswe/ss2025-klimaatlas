# Atlas of climate-related health risks

## Project overview
**Title:** Atlas of climate-related health risks
**Client:** big5health – Association for knowledge transfer and increasing health literacy and joy of life in chronic diseases
**Project duration:** until the end of June 2025

This project aims to develop a map-based information tool that shows the regionally predicted temperature increases in Austria in connection with common health risks and provides behavioral recommendations.

## Project goals
The main goal of this project is to develop an **online atlas for climate & health** that offers users the following functionalities:

- **Austria Atlas with zoom function**: ZIP code search and display of different regions.
- **Visualization of temperature increases**: Color-coded maps for the predicted annual and seasonal temperature increases.
- **Health effects**: Selective display of risks (e.g. water quality, spread of pathogens) and associated behavioral recommendations (e.g. fluid intake, sun protection).
- **Contact and service points**: Integration of information about heat protection rooms, medical services and advice centers.

## Technology stack
- **Frontend:** Angular
- **Backend:** Java SpringBoot
- **Map functionality:** OpenStreetMap, Leaflet
- **Data sources:**
  - Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG)
  - Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES)

## Schedule
- **April 2025**: Kick-off press conference for “Skin Health Month 2025”
- **June 2025**: Planned go-live of the atlas
